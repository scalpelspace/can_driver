## 1 CAN Bus Drivers

CAN drivers are implemented in the following files:

1. [can_driver.c](can_driver.c)
2. [can_driver.h](can_driver.h)

The CAN driver is intended to integrate with a `C` based DBC structure.

- To translate a DBC file into the custom CAN `C` based
  structures, [generate_can_defs.py](generate_can_defs.py) is used to generate
  the following files:

    1. example_dbc.c
    2. example_dbc.h

    - These generated files declare the message and signals in the appropriate
      type structs.
